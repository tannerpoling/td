- making cache table DAT
  - our tableUpdate script is already working every frame
  - idea: init cache table to all zeros; every frame grab the current
    dataTable value and put at cache[1279], then go backwards 1278-0
    updating each cell with the one before it
    - note! 'DAT Execute' operator runs a script every time another DAT's
      content changes, but I like having everything synced up to frames
