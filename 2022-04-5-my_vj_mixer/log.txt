- idea compositing effects instead of using 2 decks like tutorial
  - each effect has 2 outputs now: one to render on the button, and one 
    that actually gets sent out to the final composite
    - the one going to the final composite has a level CHOP before out_final
    - this level CHOP has opacity controlled by on/off button clicked state
    - effect1 has working example
- copy and pasting effect containers didn't work for some reason
  - had to set up output_onoff button from scratch, still not sure why

- audio driven stuff, using internal audio of computer
  - requires vb cable: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
- worked on shifting squares a bit
- composite / effect layering, from bottom to top:
  - spinning globes
  - tanagachi animation
  - corner gradient bass kick

- get rid of the button layout screen thing. pointless in my case, requires a bunch of fiddling with comp resolutions and layout stuff
- figuring out how to basically have some huge composite TOP with the outputs of every thing going into it
  - would be good to control whether each effect is being cooked to save on resources
  - effect container COMP
    - controls container COMP
      - 3 sliders hooked up to output of container COMP
    - output_control button COMP
      - sliders are linked all the way from controls COMP to imported tox
      - imported effect tox
        - sliders get mapped to desired range within imported tox
