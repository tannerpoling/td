- get rid of the button layout screen thing. pointless in my case, requires a bunch of fiddling with comp resolutions and layout stuff
- figuring out how to basically have some huge composite TOP with the outputs of every thing going into it
  - would be good to control whether each effect is being cooked to save on resources
  - effect container COMP
    - controls container COMP
      - 3 sliders hooked up to output of container COMP
    - output_control button COMP
      - sliders are linked all the way from controls COMP to imported tox
      - imported effect tox
        - sliders get mapped to desired range within imported tox
